To run the Go application with the Gin API, follow these steps in your terminal:

Navigate to the project directory (where your main.go and go.mod are located):

sh
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/project
Run the application using the go run command:

sh
Copy code
go run main.go
This will start the server, and the API will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

You can test the API endpoints using tools like curl, Postman, or any other HTTP client. For example, to fetch all users, you can use:


curl http://localhost:8080/users/


If you want to compile the application into a binary and run it, you can use:
**go build -o myapp
./myapp**
This will generate an executable named myapp in your project directory, which you can run directly.
